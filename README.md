# CloudArch AI 🚀

An AI-powered SaaS platform designed to automate the process of generating production-ready, secure, and optimized AWS infrastructure blueprints. By analyzing plain-language application descriptions and requirements, CloudArch AI instantly compiles tailored architecture topologies (Startup, Production, Enterprise Tiers) complete with visual node diagrams, estimated monthly costs, security guidelines, and step-by-step deployment tutorials.

## 💡 Tech Stack
A modern stack designed for high availability, security, and responsive user experience:

| Tier | Component | Technology | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | UI & Layout | React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS v3 | Fast SPA loading, modern glassmorphism design, and responsive layout. |
| | Visual Diagrams | React Flow (xyflow) | Dynamic interactive canvas for drawing and configuring infrastructure topologies. |
| | State Management | Zustand | Lightweight global store for auth sessions and state caching. |
| **Backend** | REST API | FastAPI (Python 3.11) | High-performance, asynchronous endpoints with Pydantic type safety. |
| | Database ORM | SQLAlchemy + Alembic | Async engine with automated database schema migrations. |
| **AI** | Generation Model | Google Generative AI API | Structured JSON output parser for architecture schema compilation. |
| **Database** | Database Engine | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Multi-tenant relational storage secured with Row Level Security (RLS). |

## ☁️ AWS Services Used
The application is designed to run natively on the AWS ecosystem and generates architectures featuring standard AWS services:

1. **AWS Cognito**: Provides user pools, user signups, and secure JWT-based token authentication for access control.
2. **Amazon S3**: Hosts the frontend static single-page application (SPA) and archives generated architecture JSON reports privately.
3. **Amazon CloudFront**: Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) utilizing Origin Access Control (OAC) to serve frontend assets securely.
4. **Target Architectures**: Generates AWS architectures incorporating services such as **EC2**, **ECS**, **EKS**, **RDS**, **DynamoDB**, **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **Route 53**, and **SES** mapped directly to AWS Free Tier boundaries.

## 🔮 Future Development Scope

1. **One-Click Terraform Deployment**: Allow users to download ready-to-run Terraform files for the generated architecture or deploy them directly from the dashboard.
2. **Infrastructure Cost Optimization (FinOps)**: Add budget tracking alerts and automated cost recommendations for AWS architectures.
3. **Interactive Diagram Editor**: Allow users to drag, drop, connect, and configure additional AWS services directly on the canvas to customize generated blueprints.
4. **Integrations & Notifications**: Slack/Discord webhook alerts when an architecture generation finishes, with downloadable PDF design reports.
5. **Team Collaboration**: Shared workspaces where architects and developers can collaborate, comment on, and version control architecture diagrams together.
6. **SaaS Premium Tiering**: Stripe integration to monetize enterprise-tier generation, PDF reports, and Terraform exports.
